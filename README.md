<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Using [best practices](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/#promote-immutable-versioned-terraform-modules-across-environments) for using Terraform,
the modules here currently support installing the following VMware Tanzu products:

| Product | AWS | GCP | Azure | vSphere |
|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Tanzu Application Service (a.k.a PAS) | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: |
| Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated (a.k.a PKS) | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: |

It also supports installing the following Tiles. 

| Tile | 
|------|
| Harbor Container Registry
| MySQL  |
| RabbitMQ  |
| Redis  |
| Pivotal Cloud Cache |
| Spring Cloud Services 3 |
| Spring Cloud Data Flow  |
| Metrics  |
| Healthwatch  |
| Credhub Service Broker  |
| Pivotal Anti-Virus  |
| Spring Cloud Gateway  |
| SSO |

**Note:** Not all versions of tiles have been tested, so your mileage may vary. Take a look the [tile-install-configure/configuration](tile-install-configure/configuration) to see supported tile configs.
